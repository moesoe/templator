		<p>Dear Bogyoke, I admir e you so much. You are the unique leader
			for our country. You gave up your life for sake of Burma(Myanmar).
			Moreover, you never look forward to any facilities for you as well as
			your family. Though I wasn't born in your era, I look up you!!
			Especially your efforts for our country. As your speech, you practise
			what you preast. I keep my promise you that I will follow what you
			guided to us. Your speeches are still reflecting on today's
			Burma(Myanmar)event. Your speeches are fair &amp; square. Currently, our
			country is heading to torn &amp; bad direction. Enimies are loittering
			around us. Don't the current so-called responsible persons notice?
			What are they doing? Are they satisfied with public's taxes? I will
			frankly say that we, our citizens regardless of races, must be
			consilidated in order to reach "The peaceful &amp; mordern country".
			Should we critize on each others? Instead of critizing, we should
			unite from now onwards.</p>

		<p>"This is but an inevitable and inexorable law of Karma ï¿½ that

		<p>ISN'T 15 YEARS ENOUGH FOR AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT ? When these
			military dogs, then led by Saw Maung, ruthlessly took over our
			country back in 1988, they reiterated over and over again that they
			are only acting as an interim government. So please military dogs,
			sirs, please tell us how long should an interim(short term)
			government rule ? Because as far as I can remember, the
			military(tat-ma-daw) never got my vote to rule my country and the
			tat-ma-daw also never got the votes from 80% of the population to
			rule Burma. My question is, aren't you at least one bit shameful that
			the whole world is calling you dispicable and now, even your own
			Buddies (ASEAN) are starting to show signs of abhorrance. Japan has
			cut off aid, and even china seems annoyed. So Military dogs, sirs, in
			this age of information, news spread quickly and one can't stay
			isolated. Ne Win was able to survive for 26 years mainly because of
			the lack of technology in media to spread information.</p>

		<p>In reply to Ko Kyaw Moe's comment on General Aung San General
			Aung San was not just an enthuistic hero. He deserve to be one of the
			most admirable national hero through out the history. Even British
			and Japanese generals of those time admire him. Its not that he's not
			flexible enough, he just loved our country so much and could not
			trade anything else with the country's benefit. He's just being
			HONEST. As a Burmese you should know that. The reason he was
			assassinated was because of the jealously of U Saw. Not even, all
			British politician at that time want him dead. He had long term
			vision and scope for the country so that he even planned for the
			political system. Socialism that he chose was being manipulated and
			misused by U Ne Win. Socialist parties are still winning in UK and
			France. If General Aung San was still alive, he will be flexible
			enough to cope with the current situations of the world and let our
			country addapt well with the rest of the world.</p>

		<p>Dear All, The HIV and AIDS issue in Myanmar has become

			conditions of rural areas are terribly bad. No disposable syringe, no
			gloves and no systematic sterilizations in most hospitals in Myanmar.
			Most doctors and nurses in those areas are infected with HIV. We
			cannot deny the fact that the issue is out breaking. What I am doing
			is not criticizing anyone, obviously, everyone knows whose fault is
			this, just trying to point out the fact that we need help, more help
			than we ever achieved. So please help our country in fighting the
