				<p>... We have no axe to grind, we nurture no feelings of racial
					bitterness and ill-will. We stand for friendly relations with any
					and every nation in the world. Above all, and after all, we stand
					for more than friendly relations with our neighbours. We want to be
					not merely good neighbours, but good brothers even, the moment such
					course should become possible. ...</p>
				<p>(The address of welcome delivered at the reception given in
					honour of Mr. Sarat Bose, a member of the Working Committee of the
					Indian National Congress, at the City Hall of Rangoon on July 24,

				<p>... One of the objectives that we have in our Economic and
					Social policy is to "encourage private enterprise." One of the
					points of our policy in connection with Currency and Finance is
					"raising foreign loans in the cheapest markets without the
					obligation of making concessions at the expense of national
					interests." ...</p>

				<p>... In so far as nationalism inculcates in us a sense of
					national and social justice which call upon us to fight any system
					that is oppressive or tyrannical both in our country and the world,
					there I am completely with nationalism. I hate Imperialism whether
					British or Japanese or Burmese. ...</p>
