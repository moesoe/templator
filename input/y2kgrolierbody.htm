						<p>Aung San, b. Feb. 13, 1915, d. July 19, 1947, was a founder and leader of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), the Burmese political organization that led the struggle for Burma's independence from Great Britain. After Japan invaded Burma during World War II, Aung San was named (1943) defense minister in the puppet regime of Ba Maw. He later joined the underground resistance, however, and in 1944 helped found the AFPFL. In 1945, as commander of the Burma National Army, he brought that force into the Allied camp. In April 1947 the AFPFL won an overwhelming majority in the constituent assembly, which immediately called for total independence. Aung San became head of the provisional government, but he and several other cabinet ministers were assassinated a few months before the signing of the agreement by which Burma became independent. His daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, emerged as a leader of the democratic opposition during the 1988 uprising in Burma (name of country changed to Myanmar in 1989).</p>
