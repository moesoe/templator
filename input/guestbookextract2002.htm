			<p>The web is great. Bogyok Aung San was the one and only general
				who really sacrificed his life and devoted everything for our
				country in 20th century even power was in his hand. Nowadays, some
				people are recklessly trying to hide his image as National Hero from
				public especially new generations. Teens these days don't know and
				have no respect for General Aung San as they should. This is the
				tragedy and should be stopped immediately. But no one can do it
				right now, effectively. This web page still need to be known widely
				between overseas Myanmar as well as people in the country. It was a
				coincident that i found this web page.</p>

			<p>I am a woman (62 years old) from Germany, living in the UK. I
				have been following TRUE NEWS about BELOVED BURMA since I got my
				computer in April 2002. I have read all of DASSK's books in 1998
				after my DEAREST FRIEND, a Burmese passed away on 27th January of
				that year. What I have read in the news has made me very sad and
				angry. But I am glad that the TRUTH can never be hidden!!!!!And I
				pray with all my Soul and all my Being: BELOVED BURMA WILL BE
				FREE!!!!!! I am going to Bangkok at the end of this year and I will
				make a special excursion to see for myself the BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN
				BELOVED BURMA! Yes, it is a great website. Without Bogyoke Aung San
				Burmese People would be poorer than they are now. But my LOVE is
				with Burma and Her People and I am looking forward to going there!

			<p>A couple of years ago I heard that in Burma Bogyoke Aung San
				photos are being removed. I worried so much as I love him more than
				my own father. There are the work of two men I believe unique. Lord
				Buddha and General Aung San. We can be proud of them whenever we
				mention their words to foreigners. I thought that something must be
				done to keep Bogyoke at his place, an unrival National Hero. Today
				unexpectedly I found this website and needless to say how I feel.
				The preparation in style, fashion, colour is just perfect and
				Burmese way.Classic, intelligent and well adjusted. I have a book
				about Bogyoke's writings. Amazingly he touched the Education
				subject. His view on educating is wonderful and buddhist. I can send
				the photo copies of that article if this web site owners need to put
				on the site.</p>

			<p>We Americans have just celebrated our Memorial Day on which we
				hornor those Americans who have died in the service of our
				country...people who have paid the ultimate price for freedom and
				democracy. During this weekend I also remembered Bogyoke Aung San
				and the sacrifice he made for the independence, freedom and
				democracy of Burma. His dreams remain unrealized but hopefully will
				come to fruition through the courage and dedication of his daughter
				Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. I have been so inspired by the efforts and Daw
				Suu Kyi that I created a sculptured bust of her, copies of which are
				with her family in England and at the NCGUB headquarters in
				Washington D.C. I have decided I would like to also complete a
				sculpture of Bogyoke Aung San but am having difficulty finding
				adequate reference materials from which to work. If any of you have
				pictures or can recommend where I might find some, I would be
				grateful. I look forward to the day when we can all celebrate a
				Memorial Day on the street</p>

			<p>It would be truly appreciative and in the benefit of everyone
				if you(AungSan.com) can somehow find in some historical textbooks,
				the speeches Aung San made in his early Rangoon University days
				between 1935 to 1939 and publish them on the website. We know Aung
				San didn't have the best of oratorical skills back then as a
				University student. So it would be a good model to use to motivate
				people on how they can improve themselves, why its never too late to
				improve themselves and tell them there is no reason why anyone can't
				be what Aung San once was.</p>

			<p>The more I think of how that dim-witted Ne Win hampered the

				superstitions, the more I realize the importance of being
				openminded. Aung San was exactly that and much more. The inception
				of this website comes at a crucial time when our Burmese school
				history textbooks are being rewritten and Aung San is being omitted
				more and more. But no matter what they do, be it omitting Aung San
				from our text books, scrapping the martyr's day celebrations or
				banning the literature on Aung San across the country, in the hearts
				of all Burmese, the old and the young alike, Aung San will always
				live on. Thank you AungSan.com. You have done an exceptional job for

				Thanks for sharing our Hero to anyone. Very nice. Why not you also

				than ever. I missed my country and I want to have Burma like when
				General Aung San was alive. Even though I was not born there and I
				did not know about Burma, I still want to have Burma to be more
				free-dom and liberal. So help our country to have Democracy and

				country. Let's get the Democracy for our lovely country.</p>
