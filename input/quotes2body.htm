				<p>... Every nation in the world being a conglomeration of races
					and religions should develop such a nationalism as is compatible
					with the welfare of one and all, irrespective of race or religion
					or class or sex. This is my nationalism and I believe that such a
					nationalism is but a complement of true scientific
					internationalism. ...</p>

				<p>... As a responsible leader in my country, as one who is as
					anxious as anyone in the world about peace and order, as one who
					more than anything else dislikes unnecessary strife and struggle,
					and as one among many who, taking all in all, has a desire to
					cultivate friendship with Britain, I feel it my duty to tell the
					poignant truth before it is too late. ...</p>

				<p>... Its (British) people and the peoples of the world are its
					(British imperialism's) greatest stumbling blocks, for the peoples
					are now weary of war, strife and turmoil and want peace and want to
					buy it at any price and are not at all interested in the
					maintenance of the old world and are not sanguine about the old
					world benefitting them much or hoping to live again. ...</p>

				<p>... For is it not the inherent right of any people anywhere
					in the world to strive to win their own freedom, and have they not
					the right to revolt against any and every form of tyranny,
					oppression and exploitation, foreign as well as domestic? No nation
					has the right to rule another nation, and if any oppressed nation
					attempts to overthrow their oppressors, why should that act be
					considered treasonable or traitorous? ...</p>

				<p>... Our children have suffered so much in education during

				<p>... After this World War II, the one lesson which is
					obviously impressed on the world is that no "aggressive" nation can
					win the war, much less the peace and that no nation will have
					recourse to war unless egged on by some big Power or Powers, unless
					she is sure of some sort of support or benevolent neutrality from
					some big power, for otherwise she will be committing military and
					political suicide. ...</p>
